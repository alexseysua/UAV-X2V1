UAV-X2V1

UAV (X2V1) is open source personal project in aerial unmanned vehicle development which developed in Solidworks 2022, project consist native files and also neutral file parasolid, iges.
Simulation was conducted in ANSYS 2021, for structural simulation in ANSYS Mechancial and computational fluid dynamics in ANSYS Fluent with mesh generation using Pointwise. X1V1 is compatible with various commercial flight control (Mateksys, Mamba, etc). Structure was fabricated using 3D printing with materials is PLA, ABS. In the future, simulation might be conducted in Calculix, OpenFOAM and SU2.
