Aerial-X1V2

UAV (X1V1) is open source personal project in aerial unmanned vehicle development which developed in Solidworks 2022, project consist native files and also neutral file parasolid, iges.
Simulation was conducted in ANSYS 2021. Structural simulation in ANSYS Mechancial and CFD in ANSYS Fluent with mech generation using Pointwise. X1V1 is compatible with various commercial flight control (small FC) and structural was fabricated with 3D print use PLA, ABS. In the future, simulation might be conducted in Calculix, OpenFOAM and SU2.
